# Cyber-Storm-puzzles-team-2
  This is for the Cyber Storm group of John Wolz, Joseph Ham, and Kaelyn Nguyen.
The project will consist of 3 total rasberry pis. Two of the pis are on opposite
ends of the table, each one housing two members of a team. The two teams will race
to complete three puzzles. After completion of one puzzle, a portion of a password
will be given to the player. After a player believes they have the entirepassword,
they must press the button on the breadboard of the center pi. Once pressed, a LED
will light up, and program will be launced on the center pi that will allow the 
player to enter the password. If wrong, the program will lock, and the LED will 
turn off until the button is pressed again, either by the same team or the other 
team. This continues until one team wins. This will happen 4 times with all 8 teams.
